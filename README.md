This small project is my first introduction to  game development.

Game synopsis:

When you start the game you can move the player by clicking in the designated area which is created with HTML Canvas. 
Eggs will pop-up. The player needs to move them to the north side of the map. Points are earned then by +1. Enemies are moving from the 
right to the left on the map. On a certain point of time hatchlings will appear. As a player you need to protect them from the enemies, and push 
them to the north side of the map. 

When you reach a score of 30 points, and depending on how much hatchlings you defended from the enemies, the game determines whether
you win or lose. 

Dev tools and programming languages used:

-HTML Canvas,
-JavaScript - Object-Oriented Programming with Classes.

I like to thank freeCodeCamp for the lessons.
